Project timeline:

- Spotify Auth
- Simple music player
- Spotify as login to store users (ethical considerations too)
    - I made the decision to use Atlas as my project is going to be scalable.
    - Mongoose over MongoDB
    - Decision to use dotenv
- UX: Making the "mp3 player" in the bottom right, nice visual sliding with react
    - 3 different displays: covered, covered with search, open depending on mouse movement (then put snippet of code) 
    - ^OR I have it so the text is cleard when u leave the mp3 player, maybe have a user testing seeing which is better?
