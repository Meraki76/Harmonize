Project timeline:

- Spotify Auth
- Simple music player
- Spotify as login to store users (ethical considerations too)
    - I made the decision to use Atlas as my project is going to be scalable.
    - Mongoose over MongoDB
    - Decision to use dotenv
- UX: Making the "mp3 player" in the bottom right, nice visual sliding with react
    - 3 different displays: covered, covered with search, open depending on mouse movement (then put snippets of code) 
    - ^OR I have it so the text is cleard when u leave the mp3 player, maybe have a user testing seeing which is better?
- Added schema for posts
- Added routes for posts
- Form and displaying posts (make better)

- EMILY SAYS MAKE PICTURE FURTHER APART IN MP3 PLAYER (use for report (as suggestion) dont do)


TO-DO:
    - Clean up posts (post schema is also not finished)
    - Make more scrollable (have middle get bigger and limit left and right side rather than opposite)
    - Search posts
    - Profile page and add friends
    - add searching for people to friends
    - how do i make sure other users works if i only have 1 spotify premium account ? U DONT :)

Real plan:
    - Search posts using tags
        - FOR REPORT: In future will have better tags (actually connects to artist profile page or song or album to ensure consistency)
        - add replies when you click comment
    - Profile page:
        -   Profile picture, name. Custom bio and users posts.
    - Friends page with socket:
        - For now, just search another user and u can start messaging them.
        - FOR REPORT: Talk about how in future you will have adding each other and a better screen for direct messages



Maybe unit testing: p or function (inputs that return output without side effects are easy to test, just give inputs and exprected outputs)

Feedback from other report



Evaluation:
- Talk about how u feel yourself with challenges
- ^ future plans according to this
- Discuss with friends and get their feedback
- ^Future plans inspired by feedback
- Future plans + link to conclusion

Conclusion: Summarise and wrap up things (with future plans too)
